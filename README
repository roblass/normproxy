normproxy:  This is a proxy for norm applications.  Interacts with other
^^^^^^^^^   applications over standard TCP ports, and sends and receives data
            on their behalf using NORM.

BUILD:  Building this requires NORM and Protolib.  They are available at:

http://downloads.pf.itd.nrl.navy.mil/norm/

and

http://cs.itd.nrl.navy.mil/work/protolib/index.php

respectively.  You may have to edit the Makefile to include the path to these
libraries.

USAGE:
normproxy [-B NORM-block-size] [-D debug] [-P NORM-num-parity]
[-a NORM-maddr] [-b NORM-buffer-space] [-c client-device] [-d norm-device] 
[-n NORM-session-id] [-p client-port] [-s NORM-segment-size] [-z NORM-port]

Please see the NORM documentation for the meaning of the NORM parameters (eg:
blockSize, numParity, etc).

OPTIONS:
	-B NORM-block-size, --block-size=NORM-block-size
		Sets the blockSize in NORM.  The default is 64 bytes.

	-D debug, --debug
		Turn on debugging messages.

	-P NORM-num-parity, --num-parity=NORM-num-parity
		Sets numParity in NORM.  The default is 16 bits.

	-a NORM-maddr, --mcast-address=NORM-maddr
		Set the multicast address that NORM will use to send and receive.  The
		default is 224.1.2.3.

	-b NORM-buffer-space, --buffer-space=NORM-buffer-space
		Sets bufferSpace in NORM.  The default is 1024*1024 = 1048576 bytes.

	-c device, --client-device=device
		Set the network device to listen for clients on.

	-d device, --norm-device=device
		Set the device over which to use NORM.

	-e, --duplex
		Put the software into duplex mode.  Proactively connect to a remote
		server to send outgoing data, and listen on client port for incoming
		data.

	-i id, --norm-node-id
		Use id as the NormNodeID.  Default is to generate a random number
		(after seeding with the system clock).

	-n NORM-session-id, --session-id=NORM-session-id
		Sets sessionId in NORM.  The default is 1027.

	-p port, --proxy-port=port
		Sets the port to listen for clients on (listening mode, default).  The
		default port is 1027.

	-q port, --remote-port=port
		Sets the port the proxy should connect to (proactive mode).  The
		default port is 1027.

	-s NORM-segment-size, --segment-size=NORM-segment-size
		Sets segmentSize in NORM.  The default is 1400.
	
	-y addr, --server-address=addr
		Connect to a server.  This will put the proxy into interactive mode.

	-z port, --norm-port=port
		Set the port to send / receive NORM traffic to / from.  The default is
		6003.
	

Examples:

Listen on port 5222 for incoming traffic, relay traffic between it and
NORM using the default multicast address and port.

	./normproxy -p 5222

Listen on port 1337 for a client connection and relay traffic between it and
NORM using the multicast address 224.3.2.1:5478:

	./normproxy -p 1337 -a 224.3.2.1 -z 

Connect to a server at jabber.fireopen.net:5222, and relay all traffic between
it and NORM using the default multicast address and port.
	
	./normproxy -y jabber.mychatdomain.net -p 5222


Note:  The first and last example could be put together (the first proxying
the client, the last the server) to establish an XMPP connection over NORM,
although this has not been tried.
